K means vs KNN?
K means is Unsupervised machine learning algorithm divides data points into user specified k clusters. A centroid is assigned based on the average of all points within one cluster. It's the most common clustering algorithm.

KNN is a Classification model- Supervised ML Algorithm where predictions are made based on how close a new data point is to KNOWN data points. 
Simple to implement; Robust to noisy training data; Effective if training data is large.

what is RMSE mean? Root Mean Squared Error- average squared distance the errors from the predicted line of best fit.

When to use what model for a Regression:
Know the distribution of your target variable:
For a normally distributed y and a linear relationship: OLS, LassoLars, GLM(power=0) will work best.
For polynomial relationships, polynomial regression is best.
For poisson, gamma or inverse gaussian distributions, use the Generalize Linear Model(Tweedie Regressor).
